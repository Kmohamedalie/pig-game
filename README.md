# Pig Game ðŸŽ²
Is Rolling a Die ðŸŽ² game developed by me as part of my [JavaScript programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/?utm_campaign=website1010&utm_medium=website1010&utm_source=mycoupon) course with [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/). You can find and play the game [here](https://kmohamedalie.github.io/pig-game/).

### Rules:
A demo is available at the bottom!

1. First person to get 100 points wins.
2. Each player can decide to roll the die, as much as they want but if they roll and get one they'll lose all the points in the current section.
3. It is better to press the hold button to add current points to total score.
4. If you roll and the output is 1, you'll have to pass on to the next player.
